                        <p>This is one of our more expensive trees, coming in at $499.99. Using LEDs to illuminate fiber-optic tips, the white tree lights a room with an auroral effect that displays an array of bright holiday colors in 23 different synchronized patterns. The controller enables one to easily select a lighting option, cycle through each mode, and set the timer to turn the tree on for eight hours and off for 16 hours. Its sections stack and lock into place for ease of setup and rests on the included metal stand. Shown to the right is a video of all the different customizations. </p>
